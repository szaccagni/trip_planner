            <div style="line-height: 25px;">Are you going to a new city? A new country? Perhaps multiple countries? Try to summarize your destination as best you can here! For example, if you are visiting Prague and Vienna, maybe use Central Europe. If you're headed to Munich and Berlin, Germany may be a good fit.
